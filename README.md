 ## Bugs üêõ
 I had some trouble targeting the textarea. I managed to get the the color to change with time. However, the whole row changed instead of just the text area. I would really appreciate some feedback on that particular aspect. 

 ## Credits & Resources
 I'd like to give thanks to our TA Diem for her help. I used many examples from the UT resources provided in class. As well as W3Schools and MDN.
